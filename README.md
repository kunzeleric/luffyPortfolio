# Luffy & Strawhats Portfolio

I wanted to practice some HTML and CSS techniques, so I thought I'd made Luffy's page and try different things such as keyframes and grid\flex displays!

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Take aways

- Keyframes for color-changing-borders
- Media Query (Responsive practice)
- Grid & Flex layout system.
